          America in the 1920s looked like a party – jazz, flappers, new cars,
          radios. But under the glitter, the economy was becoming dangerously
          unstable due to several key <strong>preconditions</strong>:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Wildly Unequal Prosperity:</strong> Crucial & often
            underestimated. The rich got fantastically richer (top 1% controlled
            nearly <strong>48% of national wealth by 1929</strong>, with the top
            0.1% holding 25%!). Most Americans didn't share the boom (80% had no
            savings!). Keynesian View: This meant weak underlying aggregate
            demand, masked by rising debt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Forgotten Farm Crisis:</strong> Farmers suffered
            <em>all decade long</em>. Post-WWI demand collapsed, sinking prices.
            Deeply indebted (farm mortgage debt
            <strong>$9.6 billion by 1930</strong>), farmers produced
            <em>more</em>, worsening the crash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rickety Banking System:</strong> <em>Thousands</em> (over
            25,000) of small, local banks, often weakly regulated. Key
            Vulnerability: No

            existed yet. Over 6,000 banks failed <em>before</em> 1929. A
            <em>significant number</em> of banks were heavily exposed to the
            stock market.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Debt Bubble & Speculation Frenzy:</strong> Installment Plans
            exploded. Margin Buying fueled the stock market (dangerously high
            levels). Extreme Over-indebtedness was critical. Market
            <strong>overvaluation</strong> reached extreme levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hands-Off Government (Mostly):</strong> Harding and Coolidge
            cut taxes (esp. for the rich) and weakened regulations (<strong

            Harmful <strong>tariffs</strong> (Fordney-McCumber 1922) already
            distorted markets.

            <strong>Fed-Fueled Artificial Boom?</strong> (Monetarist/Libertarian
            View): Argue the Fed kept interest rates <em>too low</em> in the
            mid-20s ("easy money"), encouraging risky speculation and

            interest rates). Fed also mismanaged gold reserves. Benjamin
            Strong's death (1928) left a leadership vacuum. Some held a
            "Liquidationist" view – let bad businesses/banks fail.

        <h2>Echoes Today: How Past Crises Shape Current Policy (March 2025)</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Depression's shadow looms large, influencing how we handle
          economic crises today. Comparing responses reveals an evolution
          towards faster, larger interventions, often enabled by the move away
          from the Gold Standard to fiat currency.
        </p>

        <h3>Contrasting Monetary Eras & Performance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Gold Standard Era (Partial, ~1944-1971):</strong> Average
            unemployment <strong>~5%</strong>. Real median male income grew
            <strong>2.7% annually</strong> (1950-68). Limited debt growth
            (Debt-to-GDP <strong>35.6%</strong> in 1971). Promoted price
            stability but limited crisis response flexibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fiat Currency Era (Post-1971):</strong> Average unemployment
            <strong>~6.1%</strong> (1971-2019). Slower income growth (<strong
              >0.2% annually</strong
            >
            1971-2011). Massive debt increase (National Debt up
            <strong>5,515%</strong> 1971-2019; Debt-to-GDP
            <strong>107.7%</strong> in 2020). Enabled flexible crisis response
            but linked to <strong>13 financial crises</strong> post-1971 and
            greater volatility/debt accumulation.

            <strong>Leading Economic Indicators (LEI)</strong> declining. CFO
            surveys show pessimism (>60% expect recession). High

        <h2>Conclusion: The Enduring Shadow</h2>
        <p>
          The Great Depression resulted from a perfect storm: 1920s structural
          weaknesses (inequality, fragile banks, debt) met disastrous policy
          failures (Fed inaction, tariffs, Gold Standard inflexibility) and
          psychological collapse, amplified globally. It proved pure
          laissez-faire inadequate. The response, particularly the New Deal,
          established a permanent, larger government role in economic
          management, regulation (<strong>FDIC</strong>, <strong>SEC</strong>),
          and social safety nets (<strong>Social Security</strong>). Though
          WWII's spending ultimately ended the crisis, the Depression
          fundamentally reshaped economic theory (Keynesianism gaining
          prominence), global institutions (<strong>IMF</strong>,
          <strong>World Bank</strong>), empowered labor, and left an indelible
          mark on the American psyche.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Keynesian Legacy:</strong> Government intervention via
            fiscal policy is now standard, though scale/timing debated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monetarist/Libertarian Legacy:</strong> Central banks
            actively manage money supply to prevent collapse; importance of
            lender of last resort accepted. Libertarians still critique
            interventions as harmful distortions, arguing government/Fed
            failures caused/prolonged the Depression.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Its lessons – dangers of deflation, need for lender of last resort,
          role of fiscal policy (and its debt implications), importance of
          international cooperation, risks of protectionism, impact of monetary
          regimes – still steer modern crisis responses. The Depression
          fundamentally altered America's relationship with its economy,
          government, and the world, shifting economic orthodoxy and policy
          frameworks.
