        The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic crisis that began
        with the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and lasted until the late
        1930s. It led to widespread unemployment, bank failures, business
        closures, and a sharp decline in international trade. This unprecedented
        economic downturn transformed American society and government policy,
        sparking intense debate about its causes and appropriate responses.
